This repository contains the code and documentation for a Data Engineer project that involves 
downloading audio book data from MySQL server, cleaning it, converting the prices from dollars to baht, 
storing the data in Google Cloud Storage, creating a pipeline using Apache Airflow to load the data into Google BigQuery, 
and finally visualizing the data using Google Looker Studio.


Utilize Apache Airflow for building a data pipeline that retrieves data from a MySQL server, performs transformations, and stores the processed data in Google Cloud Storage before loading it into Google BigQuery. The ultimate outcome will be visualized in Looker Studio, presenting a visually appealing representation based on views derived from the data stored in Google BigQuery.


Here is the final result: [Google Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/f1b10a9f-46c8-428d-96fc-ae5d1c1f30e3)
