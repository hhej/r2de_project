This repository contains the code and documentation for a Data Engineer project that involves 
downloading audio book data from MySQL server, cleaning it, converting the prices from dollars to baht, 
storing the data in Google Cloud Storage, creating a pipeline using Apache Airflow to load the data into Google BigQuery, 
and finally visualizing the data using Google Looker Studio.


The goal of this project is to collect audio book data containing information 
such as user ID, book ID, book title, price, country, category, and timestamp. 
The data will be downloaded, cleaned, and converted from dollars to baht before being stored in Google Cloud Storage.
We will then set up an Apache Airflow pipeline to automate the process of loading the data into Google BigQuery for further analysis and visualization.


Here is the final result: [Google Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/f1b10a9f-46c8-428d-96fc-ae5d1c1f30e3)
